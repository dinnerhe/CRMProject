1. Whats the difference between List, IEnumerable and IQueryable?

List allows us to add/remove/update items in a specific postion of the collection.

IEnumerable also stores data and we can read data using iteration, but we can't add or delete items in the IEnumerable.
When executing the array, it will perform filter(e.g. WHERE) on client side.

IQueryable is similar to IEnumerable, but it performs filter in server side 
so it may save some system resources when executing the query.

2. What's the difference between database first approach and code first approach.
Code first approach allows developers to create databases using entity classes.
In database first approach, developers will first create the database before writing,
an create entity data models using database later on.
